    <h1> Long Island Iced Tea </h1>
    <p> The long island iced tea is attributed to one old man bishop from a community known as Long Island. From 1920-1933 Americans tried their hands at creating new cocktails. It was around this time that the bishop combined tequila, vodka, gin, rum, whiskey and maple syrup. The drink is a perfect disguise because it look like normal ice tea. Some people argue that the drinks high alcohol content was because in that period of time alcohol was less free-flowing, which resulted in stronger drinks. </p>
    <p> The ingredients of a long island iced tea are: vodka, gin, rum, tequila, triple sec, lemon juice.</p>
